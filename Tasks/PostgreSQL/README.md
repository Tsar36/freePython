Explanations

	1.	Constructor __init__:
	•	Initializes the connection parameters for the database.
	2.	Method anonymize_table:
	•	Establishes an asynchronous connection to the database.
	•	Logs the start of the table anonymization process.
	•	Executes a SQL query to anonymize the specified table.
	•	Closes the database connection and returns the result of the query execution.
	3.	Method anonymize_tables:
	•	Creates a process pool with up to 4 worker processes.
	•	Creates tasks to anonymize tables in parallel using the process pool.
	•	Waits for all tasks to complete and gathers their results.
	•	Returns the list of results.
	4.	Stub Methods get_dbs, get_db_cursor, and install_anonymizer:
	•	These methods need to be implemented to get the list of databases, get a cursor for a database, and install the anonymizer in the database, respectively.
	5.	Function anonymize_database:
	•	Creates an instance of PSQL with connection parameters.
	•	Retrieves the list of databases.
	•	For each database, gets a cursor and installs the anonymizer.
	•	Collects information about the tables and passes it to the anonymize_tables method to anonymize the tables in parallel using 4 processes.
	6.	Function get_tables_for_db:
	•	Needs to be implemented to get the list of tables in the specified database.
	7.	Running the Asynchronous Function:
	•	Uses asyncio.run to execute the anonymize_database function asynchronously.
